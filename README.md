Code that will use the GitHub API to retrieve a summary of all opened, closed, and in progress pull requests in the last week for a given repository and print an email summary report that might be sent to a manager or Scrum-master. Choose any public target GitHub repository you like that has had at least 3 pull requests in the last week. Format the content email as you see fit, with the goal to allow the reader to easily digest the events of the past week. Please print to console the details of the email you would send (From, To, Subject, Body).
Create a Dockerfile to build an image that will run the program, however, other ways of implementing this is acceptable.

Push your solution to a fresh GitHub or BitBucket repository and Reply to this email with a link to the repo and your GitHub or BitBucket username once done.

Definition of Done:

- Your code demonstrates use of variables, looping structures, and control structures

- Your code prints a user-friendly summary of open, merged, and closed pull requests including counts of PRs as well as their titles. Use your judgement on what you think is important information.

- Your code is able to be run/compiled without errors

- Your code should be configurable when it runs. Use your judgement on what needs to be configurable.

- Your solution describes how this would be run to produce regular reports.

During the next interview, we ask that you share your screen and demonstrate the solution. We will also talk through your code and the design considerations you took in the implementation.
